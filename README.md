# sily

**Save and restore your AI coding sessions — like git, but for AI chats.**

Works across **Claude Code**, **Codex CLI**, and **OpenCode** — one tool to browse,
bookmark, and rewind sessions from any of them.

In a session that's in a good state? Save it with `sily commit`. Keep going — and if
it goes wrong, `sily revert` puts you right back at the good point, with the bad
version still kept. No copy-paste, no losing work.

---

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmitsinghTanwar007/Sily/main/install.sh | sh
```

That's it — installs to `/usr/local/bin` (already on your PATH, so `sily` works
right away; may ask for `sudo`).

Prefer not to use root? Install to a user directory instead:

```bash
SILY_BIN_DIR="$HOME/.local/bin" curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmitsinghTanwar007/Sily/main/install.sh | sh
```

(That auto-adds the directory to your shell PATH; run `source ~/.bashrc` once, or
open a new terminal.)

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. See your sessions (from every supported tool)
sily list

# 2. Save a good point (a "commit")
sily commit <session-id> -m "working great here"

# 3. ...keep working. If it goes sideways:

# 4. Go back — this prints a new session id AND the exact resume command
sily revert <commit-name>

# 5. Resume that session — sily prints the right command for the tool, e.g.:
claude --resume <id>      # Claude Code
codex resume <id>         # Codex CLI
opencode --session <id>   # OpenCode
```

You're back at the good point. Your messed-up version is still saved too — nothing
is ever lost.

## All commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `sily list` | Interactive collapsible tree of all projects (static when piped) |
| `sily list --here` | Just the current folder's sessions (static) |
| `sily log <session>` | Show a session's messages |
| `sily tree <session>` | Show a session's branch structure |
| `sily commit <session> [-m note] [--name x] [--at <msg>]` | Save a point you can return to |
| `sily commits` | List your saved points |
| `sily branch <session> [--at <msg>]` | Make a new session from any point |
| `sily revert <commit> [--hard]` | Go back to a saved point (default: keeps old version) |
| `sily diff <a> <b>` | Show where two sessions differ |
| `sily update` | Update sily to the latest release |

In the interactive `sily list` (in a terminal): `↑`/`↓` move, `→`/`Enter` expand
(everything starts collapsed), `←` collapse, `y` copy the selected session's resume
command (the right one for its tool), `q` quit.

Tips:
- A **commit** is just a tiny bookmark (a pointer), not a copy — save as many as you like.
- `revert` is **safe by default**: it creates a *new* session and leaves everything else
  intact. Use `--hard` only if you want to truly discard the later messages.
- Most commands take an optional `--at <message-id>` to act on an exact point instead
  of the latest one.

## How it works (short version)

Each tool keeps its sessions on disk — Claude Code and Codex as JSONL files, OpenCode
in a SQLite database. sily reads those, slices a session at the point you choose, and
produces a new session you can resume — all without calling any API. Your commits
(tiny pointers) live in `~/.sily/`.

Built in Rust as a clean core + pluggable adapters, one per tool.

| Tool | List / browse | Commit / branch / revert | Branch point | Resume |
|------|:---:|:---:|------|--------|
| **Claude Code** | ✅ | ✅ | message id | `claude --resume <id>` |
| **Codex CLI** | ✅ | ✅ | message number (`--at 3`) | `codex resume <id>` |
| **OpenCode** | ✅ | ✅ (experimental, via its own `export`/`import`) | message id | `opencode --session <id>` |

Where each tool's data lives: Claude `~/.claude`, Codex `~/.codex/sessions`, OpenCode
its SQLite db (`~/.local/share/opencode`). Override with `SILY_CLAUDE_HOME`,
`SILY_CODEX_HOME`, `SILY_OPENCODE_DB`.
